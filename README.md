# Pong
                Pong is a 2D sports game that simulates table tennis or Ping Pong.
                The player controls an in-game paddle by moving it horizontally across 
                the bottom of the screen. Players use the paddle to prevent the ball from 
                hitting the bottom of the grid, resulting in the end of a life. The goal 
                is for a player to continue as long as they can.
